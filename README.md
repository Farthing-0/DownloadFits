# DownloadFits
A script to download TESS fits file (lightcurve or datavalidation) quickly.

Welcome to use my script to speed up your downloading TESS data.
You may select the data you want to download and download the origin data download script from [here](https://archive.stsci.edu/tess/bulk_downloads/bulk_downloads_ffi-tp-lc-dv.html). Then put it in the same folder with this script.

The file 'tesscurl_sector_6_lc.sh' is just for example and you can delete it.
